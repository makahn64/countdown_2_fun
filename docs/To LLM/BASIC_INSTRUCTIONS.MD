1. All code is in Typescript
2. No default imports unless required by framework
3. Use Vite with React and Tailwind CSS
4. Code style:
    - indents are 2 spaces
    - space after/before curly braces { }
    - Single quotes preferred except in JSX where double quotes are used
5. Unit tests for everything, expect 80% coverage
6. You will describe what was done for each step in a file called ./docs/from LLM/STATUS_REPORT_STEP_X.md where X is the step number.
7. Ask for confirmation between steps or major code changes
