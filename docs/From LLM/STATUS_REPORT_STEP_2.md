# Status Report - Step 2

## What Was Accomplished

### Date Calculation Function Implementation
- Created `src/utils/dateCalculations.ts` with comprehensive date calculation logic
- Implemented `calculateDaysRemaining()` function that returns:
  - `totalDaysRemaining`: Days until May 15, 2026
  - `workDaysRemaining`: Work days excluding weekends, holidays, and vacation
- Added US Federal Holidays for 2024-2026 (excluding weekends)
- Set vacation days to 20 as specified in requirements

### UI Updates
- Updated `src/App.tsx` to display countdown information underneath "Hello World"
- Added styled countdown display with:
  - Total Days Remaining (highlighted in yellow)
  - Work Days Remaining (highlighted in green)
  - Explanatory text about exclusions
- Maintained dark purple theme with improved visual hierarchy

### Testing Implementation
- Installed Vitest for unit testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/utils/__tests__/dateCalculations.test.ts`
- Added test script to `package.json`
- Achieved 100% test coverage for the date calculation function
- All 5 tests passing successfully

## Technical Implementation Details

### Date Calculation Logic
- **Target Date**: May 15, 2026 (hardcoded constant)
- **Weekend Calculation**: 2 days per week (simplified approach)
- **Holiday Exclusion**: 23 US Federal Holidays between 2024-2026
- **Vacation Days**: 20 days subtracted from work days
- **Edge Case Handling**: Prevents negative work days

### US Federal Holidays Included
- New Year's Day, MLK Day, Presidents' Day
- Memorial Day, Juneteenth, Independence Day
- Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans Day
- Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Layout**: Vertical stacking with proper spacing
- **Colors**: Yellow for total days, green for work days
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with appropriate font sizes
- **Information**: Added explanatory text about exclusions
- **Responsiveness**: Maintains centered layout on different screen sizes

## Code Quality Standards Met

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with proper interfaces
- **Coding Style**: 2-space indents, proper spacing around braces
- **Single Quotes**: Used consistently (except in JSX where double quotes are used)
- **No Default Imports**: Followed framework requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive coverage with edge case testing

## Testing Results

✅ **Test Coverage**: 100% for date calculation function
✅ **Tests Passing**: 5/5 tests successful
✅ **Edge Cases Covered**: 
- Normal date calculations
- Very close target dates
- Past target dates
- Consistent results validation

## Current Application Status

- **Functionality**: ✅ Fully implemented and working
- **Display**: ✅ Shows both total and work days remaining
- **Styling**: ✅ Tailwind CSS properly applied
- **Server**: ✅ Running without errors on localhost:5173
- **Tests**: ✅ All passing with comprehensive coverage

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/utils/dateCalculations.ts` - New utility function
- `src/utils/__tests__/dateCalculations.test.ts` - Test suite
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated UI to display countdown
- `package.json` - Added test script and Vitest dependency

## Next Steps

The application is now ready for Step 3. The countdown functionality is:
